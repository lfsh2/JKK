			<h1>Interior Design Process</h1>

			<div class="text-block">
				<img src="../../../ASSETS/services/Design/inte8.jpg" alt="">

				<p>Our interior design process is thorough and comprehensive, covering every aspect from initial concept to final decoration. We ensure that every detail is meticulously planned and executed, right down to the flowers in the vase and pictures on the wall.</p>

				<p><b>Initial Consultation-</b> During a face-to-face meeting, we listen carefully to our client's needs, desires, and questions regarding the spaces to be designed. This helps us understand their preferences and priorities through meaningful discussions, showing samples, and discussing options for materials, colors, and styles that will shape the project.</p>

				<p><b>Design Development:</b> Based on the initial consultation, we develop several layout options. To aid visualization, we present 3D renderings and photographic references that capture the essence of the project concept. The client plays a crucial role in this phase, actively participating and providing feedback until we reach a final approved layout.</p>

				<p><b>Budgeting and Planning:</b> We create detailed executive drawings and meticulously budget all products and services required for the design. This includes presenting a clear spreadsheet outlining the total investment and estimated timeline for execution.</p>

				<p><b>Project Management:</b> Throughout the entire process, we maintain close involvement, ensuring that all aspects align with the client's vision and interests. We liaise with suppliers, oversee scheduling, and supervise the installation of joinery, delivery of furniture, and all finishing touches.</p>

				<p><b>Final Production and Decoration</b> Once construction and installation are complete, we focus on enhancing the ambiance with decorative elements. We schedule a final day to meticulously style the interiors, placing decorative objects to add the finishing touches. By the end of this day, we present the completed property to the client, ready to be enjoyed with all details in place, from framed pictures to carefully arranged flowers. This commitment to delivering fully finished and decorated spaces sets us apart in our industry.</p>
